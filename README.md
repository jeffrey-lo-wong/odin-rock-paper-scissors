# odin-rock-paper-scissors
Pre-Project:
This project will be a basic rock-paper-scissors game. It will have the basic components of a for loop, some conditional statements and some other tools. The completion of this project will demonstrate my basic knowledge of Javascript while also showcasing problem-solving skills. 

Post-Project:
Completion of this project was not difficult when constructing the algorithms being implemented within the code. However, I found myself struggling immensly when it came to Javascript syntax and its functions. Functional languages are quite difficult to me. I have coded in Java and naively believed that I could swim through Javascript effortlessly. How wrong I was.
