Pre-Project:
This project will be a basic rock-paper-scissors game. It will have the basic components of a for loop, some conditional statements and some other tools. The completion of this project will demonstrate my basic knowledge of Javascript while also showcasing problem-solving skills. 

Post-Project:
Completion of this project was not difficult when constructing the algorithms being implemented within the code. However, I found myself struggling immensly when it came to Javascript syntax and its functions. Functional languages are quite difficult for me. I have coded in Java and naively believed that I could swim through Javascript effortlessly. How wrong I was. 

Update: 
I finished the UI portion of this project. It was really tough figuring out DOMS and why some things weren't working. Next time I need better organization of my code. Looking at it now, I can see that I could have used functions to shorten the length of the code. Next time I will do better
